      <p>
        Hello! Welcome to Laura Belle's Craftwell. We are a family-owned company, 
        here to bring a little light into your life. We specialize in <i>amigurumi</i>, 
        and we are excited to be announcing that our line of chrocheted accessories 
        (such as comfy scarfs and cute hats) will be coming soon!
      </p>
      <h3 style="font-family:'Yu Gothic'; text-transform: uppercase;">What are Amigurumi?</h3>

      <p>
        "Amigurumi" is a Japanese art of knitting or crocheting small, stuffed
        yarn creatures. The word is a combination of the Japanese words <i>ami</i>,
        meaning crocheted or knitted, and <i>nuigurumi</i>, meaning stuffed doll.
        What's not to love?
          </p>

      <p>
        They're squishy, they're cute, they're safe, they're homemade. We offer
        a variety of yarn animals that are great for any age. Each yarnimal is
        carefully crafted by hand to produce the highest amount of cuteness and
        fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you buy our yarnimals, you are helping support the entrepreneurship of a
        family excited to do more. Laura, the founder of this company, is still in high
        school, but she is starting her life off right with a new idea that will help kids
        and parents alike. Thank you for supporting Laura Belle's Craftwell!
